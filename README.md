## *What is this?*
This project is my introduction to creating and intelligent agent whilst also learning the Godot 4 engine!

I'll do my best in explaining step by step this project.

## Things I learned while making this
- What are intelligent agents
- What are heuristics
- Game and Decision Theory
- The A* Algorithm on a discrete space
- The procedural generation of rooms inside Godot 4
- How to implement AI to my characters in Godot 4
- How to estimate cost and heuristics

### Quick note
This project was made in and for 4.3 Stable. I don't assure you that i'll work on later or earlier versions of the game engine.

## How to use?
Just download the repo from here and open the AStar.exe file. The game has near to zero user input.
Once the game starts just hit Start to watch the simulation. At anytime you can hit the 'esc' key on your keyboard to bring up options.
Every iteration of the game will be different as its all procedurally generated. 

It may contain certain bugs such as:
- The book spawning in a wall.
- The player spawning in the book.
